# emcee code U Oslo admission
This is repository containing the MCMC code which I wrote in my master's thesis project. It calculates the posterior probability distribution of the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$. Using the MCMC algorithm ‘emcee’, we have tried to reproduce the cosmological constraints obtained by Allen et al. (2003).

To run this code, I used a module written by my supervisor, Dr. Surhud More. Detailed instructions on downloading and installing this module, including its documentation can be found here: http://surhudm.github.io/aum/install.html#
